Using RTL_433 to decode my Fortress SO2 security system for conversion from landline to a web based notification system.
While mapping the 433MHZ sensors, 2 of the keys on the keyfobs did not decode.  The other 2 registered as Chuango-Security on both keyfobs.
rtl_433 was run with -G 4, -a 4, -A, -S, and recommended Flex files were all run.  All 4 keys also registered as Accurite sensors.  I am new at this
but am trying to resolve this on my own with a little assistance.  I have all the required files and a picture of the control panel and keyfob.
Some anomalies which I noticed were addressed in the examples are the Motion detectors being classified as generic, and timing changes to increase samples.
